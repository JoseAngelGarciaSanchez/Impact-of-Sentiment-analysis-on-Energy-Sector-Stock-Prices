I recently had to use ICE car.Also found that since I changed to EV the local petrol station no longer works on the Shell app. It's a small function but made petrol stations just that bit nicer to use. Now it's worse again:(EV is such a dream never having to visit petrol stations

Yet here you are, smugly putting down others risking far more than you in order to oppose those who are ruining our collective future for profit.

Mediate more. Rid yourself of your own poisonous ego.

Just to clarify, you are asking what the alternative is to throwing black paint on university buildings whose sources of funding you disagree with? It seems clear to you no course of action is possible other than to throw paint on buildings?

They and Republicans got us here. I remember Reagan taking Carter’s solar panels off the White House as soon as he could. Then dismantling the Fairness in Broadcasting Act of 1949 & rushing to give Murdoch citizenship. Fox ensued.

There really is no good way to clean up from oil spills. Despite huge efforts & best after-the-fact attempts, 95% or more of oil remains in the oceans after almost all disasters.

""Clean up"" is more often than not a cover up.  

Emphasis should be on ways to prevent spills! twitter.com/PaulEDawson/st…",,,
